 * and increment `count`. The scheduler reads the CQ after all
 * subtasks have returned and creates completion conditions accordingly.
 *
 * Memory ordering contract:
 *   - Kernel writes entries[i] fields BEFORE incrementing count.
 *   - Kernel flushes caches (dcci+dsb on HW) before returning.
 *   - Scheduler reads only after detecting task_status==0,
 *     which implies all kernel writes are visible.
