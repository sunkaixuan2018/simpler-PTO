/**
 * @file device_prefetch.h
 * @brief SDMA Prefetch Interface for AICPU
 *
 * Provides device-side SDMA prefetch to warm AICore's L2 cache before
 * kernel execution. AICPU and AICore have separate L2 caches, so this
 * uses the SDMA engine (via direct STARS SQ submission) to push data
 * into AICore's L2.
 *
 * The mechanism writes CMO PREFETCH SQEs directly to the STARS submission
 * queue and rings the hardware doorbell — same protocol as shmem but from
 * AICPU instead of AICore.
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * - a2a3: Real hardware using STARS SDMA SQ (channel info set by host)
 * - a2a3sim: No-op (no SDMA engine in simulation)
