/**
 * Worker — top-level distributed worker node.
 *
 * Worker is the implementation of one level in the hierarchy (L3, L4, …).
 * From the level above it looks like an IWorker; internally it contains the
 * full scheduling engine (TensorMap, Allocator, Scope, Orchestrator, Scheduler)
 * and a set of sub-IWorkers it dispatches to.
 *
 * Public surface:
 *   - add_worker(type, IWorker*)  — register sub-workers (before init)
 *   - init() / close()             — lifecycle
 *   - get_orchestrator()           — accessor used by Worker::run / Python facade
 *                                    (scope_begin / drain / scope_end live on the
 *                                     Orchestrator, not here)
 *   - run(payload)                 — IWorker entry (placeholder for L4+ recursion)
 *
 * Worker holds no submit / scope / drain / active-task bookkeeping — those
 * concepts belong to Orchestrator.
 *
 * Construction is separated from `init()` so Python callers can mmap the
 * HeapRing in the parent process *before* forking children (children see the
 * MAP_SHARED region at the same virtual address). Start the scheduler and
 * WorkerThreads with `init()` only after forks have happened.
