/**
 * Context-lifetime state for the borrowed kernel execution mode.
 *
 * This object owns the dedicated AICPU stream, hidden AICore stream and event set; every
 * graph-visible persistent execution resource belongs here rather than in a
 * per-invocation object. The caller stream is never stored or destroyed —
 * each launch receives it as a borrowed argument.
 *
 * Phase machine:
 *   New → (initialize) → Collecting ⇄ ReadyEnqueued
 *   Collecting/ReadyEnqueued → (poison, on partial-enqueue failure) → Poisoned
 *   Collecting/ReadyEnqueued/Poisoned → (close) → Closing → Closed
 * Initializing is held only inside initialize()'s critical section and the
 * lock is released with the phase already past it, so no caller observes it;
 * close()'s rejection of it is defensive. The stream and event sets are the
 * launch protocol's shared vocabulary, common to both runtimes, so
 * initialize() creates all of them unconditionally.
 *
 * A pre-enqueue validation failure leaves the phase unchanged. Poisoned
 * rejects dispatch but still accepts close. Closing is sticky: entered
 * before the first destructive teardown step, it rejects all dispatch, and a
 * cleanup failure stays in Closing for explicit close() retry — successfully
 * destroyed handles are nulled, so a retry redoes only the remainder.
 *
 * Error reporting keeps two slots so a controlled runtime error can never
 * mask a real teardown failure: last_runtime_error() latches the first
 * poison cause, unexpected_teardown_error() latches the first real cleanup
 * failure. A caller deciding an overall verdict consults them in that order
 * before reporting controlled success.
 *
 * The destructor performs no runtime calls. If a caller skips explicit close
 * while an ACLGraph can still reference these handles, freeing them would be
 * a use-after-free, so the handles leak instead. Refusing to destroy an
 * unclosed kernel runner is the public C API's half of that contract:
 * destroy_device_context refuses while this object owns stream/event handles
 * or the runner has an outstanding native run.
