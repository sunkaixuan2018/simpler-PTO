/**
 * Runtime-agnostic helper for the kernel-upload half of register_callable_impl.
 *
 * Each runtime variant (host_build_graph, tensormap_and_ringbuffer, ...) needs
 * to: upload the ChipCallable buffer to device once, then translate each child
 * kernel's storage offset into a device address that AICPU dispatch can read
 * out of Runtime::func_id_to_addr_[]. The upload + offset arithmetic does not
 * depend on the surrounding runtime, only on the ChipCallable layout and the
 * platform's upload entry point. Callers retain the func_id range check
 * because RUNTIME_MAX_FUNC_ID lives in each runtime's own headers.

 *                       (orch_so_* stay null since orch SO never crosses
 *                       host/device on this runtime)
 *   - tensormap_and_ringbuffer: kernel_addrs + chip buffer lease +
 *                       orch_so_size + func_name + config_name (the orch SO
 *                       is the leading slice of ChipCallable::storage_)
 *
 * func_name / config_name are non-empty only for the trb path; the hbg path
 * resolves its entry symbol during register_callable_impl and stores the
 * resulting function pointer in host_orch_func_ptr directly.
