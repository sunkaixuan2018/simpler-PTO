 * Implementations:
 *   onboard/host/comm_hccl.cpp — HCCL backend (links CANN hccl/hccl_fwk)
 *   sim/host/comm_sim.cpp      — malloc-based simulation
 *
 * All functions are compiled into libhost_runtime.so. The linker selects

 * allocations are disambiguated by `allocation_id`, which is mixed into

 * participating chip must call this with matching arguments; non-members
 * of the subset do NOT call it.  Internal file barriers synchronise the
 * subset, so the parent (orchestrator) only needs to dispatch and wait
 * for completion — it does not need to broker the cross-rank handshake.
 *
 * On HCCL this performs aclrtMalloc + the same Path-D IPC pattern as
 * comm_alloc_windows but on a fresh per-allocation buffer.  On sim it
 * shm_opens a fresh POSIX shm scoped by `allocation_id`.
