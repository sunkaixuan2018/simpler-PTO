# Run hardware device tests for a single runtime specified by $ARGUMENTS

1. Validate that `$ARGUMENTS` is one of: `host_build_graph`, `aicpu_build_graph`, `tensormap_and_ringbuffer`. If not, list the valid runtimes and stop.
2. Check `command -v npu-smi` — if not found, tell the user to use `/test-runtime-sim` instead and stop.
3. **Detect platform**: Run `npu-smi info` and parse the chip name. Map `910B`/`910C` → `a2a3`, `950` → `a5`. If unrecognized, warn and default to `a2a3`.
4. Read `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to extract the current `--pto-isa-commit` and `--pto-session-timeout` values from the `st-onboard-<platform>` job's `pytest` invocation.
5. From the `npu-smi info` output, find devices whose **HBM-Usage is 0** (idle).
6. From the idle devices, take **at most 4**. If no idle device is found, report the situation and stop.
7. Build the device range flag: from the idle devices, find the **longest consecutive sub-range** (at most 4). Pass as `--device <start>-<end>`. If no consecutive pair exists, use the lowest-ID idle device as `--device <id>`.
8. Run:

   ```bash
   pytest examples tests/st --platform <platform> --runtime $ARGUMENTS \
     --device <range-or-id> \
     --pto-session-timeout <timeout> --clone-protocol https \
     --pto-isa-commit <commit> -v
   ```

   Hardware parallelism is auto-driven by `--device` (one subprocess per device); no extra flag needed.
9. Report the results summary (pass/fail counts per task).
10. If any tests fail, show the relevant error output and which device failed.
