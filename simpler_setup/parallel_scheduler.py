"""Device-aware subprocess scheduler for parallel L3 test dispatch.

Given a list of jobs, each declaring how many devices it needs, this module
runs them as isolated subprocesses in parallel up to the device pool's
capacity. Used by the pytest test dispatcher (conftest.py) and the standalone
runner (scene_test.run_module) to parallelize Level-3 test cases.

Concurrency bound: the caller's ``device_ids`` list size. No separate
``--max-parallel`` knob — shrink ``-d`` to throttle.

Static safety: any job where ``device_count > len(device_ids)`` fails the
whole batch up front (otherwise it would deadlock on the wait queue).

Fail-fast: when ``fail_fast=True`` and any job fails, cancel the pending
queue, SIGTERM running children, and return promptly.

    Scheduling is FIFO: jobs are popped in order; if the head can't be placed

    we wait for a running job to finish rather than skip ahead. Simple and
    predictable.

    Args:
        jobs: jobs to dispatch, in preferred order.
        device_ids: full pool of available device ids. ``len(device_ids)`` is
            the device-side hard cap — a single job is still capped by its
            own ``device_count``, and the sum of running jobs' ``device_count``
            can never exceed the pool.
        max_parallel: max number of subprocesses in flight simultaneously
            (``-j`` semantics, same as ``make -j``). ``None`` means "no
            extra cap" and the only bound is the device pool. Use this to
            throttle CPU contention on sim where one subprocess can already
            fork many internal workers.
        fail_fast: on first non-zero return code, cancel remaining queue and
            terminate running children.
        poll_interval_s: how often to check for finished children.
        on_job_done: called (thread-safe w.r.t. this function — which is
            single-threaded) whenever a job completes, useful for streaming
            pytest reports or printing PASS/FAIL lines.
