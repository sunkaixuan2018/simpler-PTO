# Dynamic Linking and Thread-Local Storage

This document describes how shared libraries are loaded, symbols are resolved,
and per-thread state is managed across simulation and onboard platforms.

## SO Loading Hierarchy

### Simulation

```text
Python process (ChipWorker)
  |
  dlopen(host_runtime.so, RTLD_GLOBAL)        ← host SO
    |
    +-- DeviceRunner::ensure_binaries_loaded()
    |     |
    |     +-- dlopen(aicpu_sim_XXXXXX, RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL)    ← AICPU SO (temp file)
    |     |     |
    |     |     +-- dlopen(libdevice_orch_<PID>.so, RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_LOCAL)  ← orch SO (temp file)
    |     |
    |     +-- dlopen(aicore_sim_XXXXXX, RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL)   ← AICore SO (temp file)
    |
    +-- DeviceRunner::upload_chip_callable_buffer()
          |
          +-- for each child: dlopen(kernel_<func_id>_XXXXXX, RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL)  ← kernel SOs (temp file, per child)
```

### Onboard

```text
Python process (ChipWorker)
  |
  dlopen(host_runtime.so, RTLD_GLOBAL)        ← host SO
    |
    +-- DeviceRunner (handle-based, one per ChipWorker)
    |     |
    |     +-- LoadAicpuOp::BootstrapDispatcher()
    |     |     |
    |     |     +-- rtAicpuKernelLaunchExWithArgs(KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_KFC)
    |     |           dispatcher writes simpler_inner_<fp>_<device_id>.so
    |     |
    |     +-- LoadAicpuOp::Init()
    |     |     |
    |     |     +-- rtsBinaryLoadFromFile(...)       ← register preinstall runtime SO
    |     |     +-- rtsFuncGetByName(...)            ← cache AICPU entry handles
    |     |
    |     +-- rtsLaunchCpuKernel(...)                ← per-task AICPU launches
    |     +-- rtRegisterAllKernel(aicore_binary)     ← CANN kernel registration
    |
    +-- dlopen("libascend_hal.so", RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL)  ← CANN HAL (profiling only)
```

Key difference: onboard does **not** dlopen AICPU/AICore as host-side SOs.
The runtime AICPU SO is written once to the device preinstall path through
the dispatcher bootstrap, then registered and launched by CANN runtime handles.
AICore remains a CANN-registered binary blob.

## RTLD Flags and Rationale

### Host Runtime SO: `RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL`

`RTLD_GLOBAL` is **required**. PTO ISA's TPUSH/TPOP instructions (AIC-AIV
data transfer for mix-type kernels) use `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)` internally
to locate shared storage hooks defined in the host SO:

```cpp
// PTO ISA: pto/common/cpu_stub.hpp
inline GetSharedStorageHookFn ResolveSharedStorageHook() {
    static auto hook = reinterpret_cast<...>(
        dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "pto_cpu_sim_get_shared_storage"));
    return hook;
}
```

With `RTLD_LOCAL`, this symbol is not in the global scope. The hook returns
`nullptr`, and TPUSH/TPOP fall back to a `static` local variable per SO.
Since AIC and AIV kernel threads run in different contexts, they get separate
storage instances and deadlock — the producer (TPUSH) writes to one storage,
the consumer (TPOP) waits on another.

**Cross-runtime isolation** (running different runtime SOs sequentially) relies
on `-fno-gnu-unique` to ensure `dlclose` actually unloads the SO. The next
`dlopen` with `RTLD_GLOBAL` then replaces the global symbol scope with the
new runtime's symbols.

### Inner SOs: `RTLD_LOCAL`

All SOs loaded by DeviceRunner (AICPU, AICore, kernel, orchestration) use
`RTLD_LOCAL` to prevent symbol pollution between them. Functions that inner
SOs need from the host SO are passed via explicit function pointer injection
(see "Function Pointer Injection" below).

### Orchestration SO: `RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_LOCAL`

Loaded by the AICPU executor at runtime from a temp file. Uses `RTLD_LAZY`
because not all symbols may be referenced. Communicates with the runtime
through a function pointer table (`RuntimeOps`), not direct symbol
linkage.

`RuntimeOps` is a binary ABI without size or version negotiation.
Orchestration SOs and their runtime must therefore be built from the same
simpler revision. Changing the table's field count, order, or signatures
invalidates previously built orchestration SOs; cached or prebuilt artifacts
must be rebuilt before they are loaded by the updated runtime.

**File path collision**: all runtimes write the orch SO to
`/var/tmp/libdevice_orch_<PID>.so`. Safe in serial execution (each task
dlcloses before the next writes), but would conflict in parallel in-process
execution.

### CANN HAL: `RTLD_NOW | RTLD_LOCAL`

`libascend_hal.so` is loaded only for performance profiling (SVM memory
mapping via `halHostRegister`/`halHostUnregister`). The handle is cached
in a file-scope `g_hal_handle` and never explicitly dlclosed.

## All dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT) Calls

| Symbol | File | Used by | How it works |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ------------ |
| `pto_cpu_sim_set_execution_context` | PTO ISA `cpu_stub.hpp` | Kernel `set_execution_context()` | Sim: injected via `set_sim_context_helpers` (bypasses dlsym) |
| `pto_cpu_sim_get_execution_context` | PTO ISA `cpu_stub.hpp` | Kernel `get_block_idx()` etc. | Sim: same injection mechanism |
| `pto_cpu_sim_get_shared_storage` | PTO ISA `cpu_stub.hpp` | TPUSH/TPOP shared state | Requires `RTLD_GLOBAL` on host SO |
| `pto_cpu_sim_get_task_cookie` | PTO ISA `cpu_stub.hpp` | Kernel `get_task_cookie()` | Requires `RTLD_GLOBAL` on host SO |
| `halMemAlloc` / `halMemFree` | Onboard `device_malloc.cpp` | AICPU device memory | Resolved once, cached in statics |
| `halGetDeviceInfoByBuff` | Onboard `host_regs.cpp` | Core validity query | a2a3 only |
| `halMemCtl` | Onboard `host_regs.cpp` | Register address mapping | a2a3 only |
| `halResMap` | Onboard `host_regs.cpp` | Per-core register mapping | a5 only |

The first two are called from AICore SO code (via `inner_kernel.h` macros).
They were converted from `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` to function pointer injection
through `set_sim_context_helpers()`, so they work under both `RTLD_GLOBAL`
and `RTLD_LOCAL`.

The next two (`get_shared_storage`, `get_task_cookie`) are called from PTO ISA
template code instantiated **inside kernel SOs** — not the AICore SO. Function
pointer injection into the AICore SO cannot reach them. They require the host
SO to be loaded with `RTLD_GLOBAL`.

The HAL symbols are onboard-only. CANN's scheduler process pre-loads
`libascend_hal.so` into the global scope before launching AICPU kernels.

## Function Pointer Injection

To avoid `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` in inner SOs loaded with `RTLD_LOCAL`,
DeviceRunner passes function pointers after dlopen:

**AICore SO** (`set_sim_context_helpers`):

```text
DeviceRunner → dlsym(aicore_handle, "set_sim_context_helpers")
             → set_helpers(pto_cpu_sim_set_execution_context,
                           pto_cpu_sim_set_task_cookie,
                           platform_get_cpu_sim_task_cookie)
```

**AICPU SO** (`set_aicpu_sim_context_helpers`):

```text
DeviceRunner → dlsym(aicpu_handle, "set_aicpu_sim_context_helpers")
             → set_helpers(platform_set_cpu_sim_task_cookie)
```

These injected function pointers are stored as globals in the respective SOs
and called instead of `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)`.

## Thread-Local Storage

### Design Principle

**No C++ `thread_local` in any SO that gets dlclosed and re-dlopen'd.**
C++ `thread_local` uses ELF TLSDESC on aarch64, which has known issues
with dlclose/re-dlopen cycles in older glibc versions. The sim platform
uses `pthread_key_t` (POSIX TLS) for per-thread state in framework SOs.

### All TLS Variables

| Variable | Storage | SO | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- | -- | ------- |
| `g_reg_base_key` | `pthread_key_t` | AICore SO | Per-core simulated register base address |
| `g_core_id_key` | `pthread_key_t` | AICore SO | Per-core physical core ID |
| `g_device_id_key` | `pthread_key_t` | Sim Context SO (`libcpu_sim_context.so`) | Per-thread device binding (device_id) |
| `g_subblock_id_key` | `pthread_key_t` | Sim Context SO (`libcpu_sim_context.so`) | Per-thread subblock identity (for TPUSH/TPOP) |
| `g_cluster_id_key` | `pthread_key_t` | Sim Context SO (`libcpu_sim_context.so`) | Per-thread cluster identity (for TPUSH/TPOP) |
| `s_orch_thread_idx` | `__thread int` | AICPU SO | Profiling thread index (profiling off by default) |
| `g_platform_phase_base` | plain global + `extern "C"` setter | AICPU SO | Device-phase buffer base; published by host (onboard kernel.cpp / sim dlsym), read by the `[STRACE]` phase stamps. Per-thread slotting via the affinity pthread-key index, not TLS. |
| strace `inv`/`depth`/`hid` | `pthread_key_t` (`ThreadState`) | host runtime SO | Per-thread `[STRACE]` host-trace state (was C++ `thread_local`, converted per this rule). |
| `execution_context` | `thread_local` | Kernel SO (PTO ISA) | Per-thread execution context (fallback, cached values only) |
| `NPUMemoryModel::instance` | `thread_local` | Kernel SO (PTO ISA) | Per-core memory model simulation |

### Known Risks

1. **`s_orch_thread_idx`** uses `__thread` (ELF TLS) in the AICPU SO. Could
   cause issues on aarch64 glibc <2.39 if the AICPU SO is dlclosed and
   re-dlopen'd while profiling is enabled. Currently safe because profiling
   is off by default and the variable is only accessed during profiling.

2. **PTO ISA `thread_local`** variables (`execution_context`,
   `NPUMemoryModel::instance`) are in kernel SOs. Kernel SOs are short-lived
   (loaded per task, dlclosed after validation), and each kernel thread is
   freshly created, so stale TLS is not a concern in practice.

## `-fno-gnu-unique`

GCC emits `STB_GNU_UNIQUE` binding for `static` locals in inline/template
functions. glibc marks such SOs as `NODELETE`, making `dlclose` a no-op.
When multiple runtime SOs are loaded sequentially with `RTLD_GLOBAL`, the
first SO's symbols persist and pollute the second.

Applied to all sim compilation paths:

- 6 CMakeLists (host/aicpu/aicore for a2a3 and a5): `$<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU>:-fno-gnu-unique>`
- `toolchain.py` (GxxToolchain, Aarch64GxxToolchain): appended to compile flags

Additionally, `data_type.h::get_element_size()` uses `constexpr static`
instead of `static` to avoid generating UNIQUE symbols at the source level.

## AicpuExecutor::deinit() and SchedulerContext::deinit()

The AICPU SO contains a file-scope static `AicpuExecutor g_aicpu_executor`,
which holds a `SchedulerContext sched_ctx_` member owning all scheduler
state (core trackers, dispatch payloads, drain state, task counters,
core-transition flags, one-time init coordination, etc.).

When the AICPU SO is dlclosed and re-dlopen'd between tasks, the static is
reconstructed. But when the AICPU SO is **reused** (same runtime, consecutive
tasks), `deinit()` must reset all fields. Responsibilities are split so that
SchedulerContext owns its own teardown:

- `SchedulerContext::deinit()` resets every scheduler-owned field —
  per-core states, payloads, sync-start drain coordination
  (`sync_start_pending` / `drain_attempt` / `drain_ack_tokens_` /
  `pending_task` / parallel-stage state), task counters, worker-id lists,
  core trackers, `cores_total_num_` / `aic_count_` / `aiv_count_`,
  `regs_`, `sched_`, and `func_id_to_addr_`.
- `AicpuExecutor::deinit()` calls `sched_ctx_.deinit()` first, then resets
  only its own fields: `thread_num_`, `sched_thread_num_`,
  `orch_func_`, `orch_args_cached_`, `orch_so_handle_`, `orch_so_path_`,
  `runtime_init_ready_`, and the lifecycle atomics
  (`initialized_`, `init_done_`, `init_failed_`, `finished_`, `thread_idx_`,
  `finished_count_`).

Applies to all 4 runtime executors: a2a3 (hbg, tmr), a5 (hbg, tmr).

## SO Handle Caching and Reuse

### Simulation

| SO | Caching | Lifecycle |
| -- | ------- | --------- |
| Sim context | Process registry keyed by path | Process lifetime: loaded once with `RTLD_GLOBAL`, never explicitly closed |
| Host runtime | `ChipWorker::lib_handle_` | Per-init: dlopen in `init()`, dlclose in `finalize()` |
| AICPU | `DeviceRunner::aicpu_so_handle_` | Per-init: loaded lazily by the first `prepare_execution()`, retained across runs, closed by `finalize()` |
| AICore | `DeviceRunner::aicore_so_handle_` | Per-run: reloaded for the run's kernel binary, closed after a successful `drain_execution()` (or by final cleanup) |
| Kernel | `DeviceRunner::func_id_to_addr_` (map by func_id) | Per-task: uploaded in `init_runtime_impl()`, removed in `validate_runtime_impl()` |
| Orchestration | `AicpuExecutor::orch_so_handle_` | Per-run: loaded by orchestrator thread, closed by last thread in `deinit()` |

### Onboard

| Resource | Caching | Lifecycle |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| Host runtime | `ChipWorker::lib_handle_` | Per-runtime-group: shared across tasks in same group |
| Dispatcher SO bytes | `DeviceRunnerBase::dispatcher_so_binary_` | Init-only: passed to `LoadAicpuOp::BootstrapDispatcher`, then cleared |
| Runtime AICPU SO | Preinstall file `simpler_inner_<fp>_<device_id>.so` | Written once through dispatcher bootstrap, then registered via `rtsBinaryLoadFromFile` |
| AICPU entry handles | `LoadAicpuOp` cached `rtFuncHandle`s | Per-runtime-group: reused by `rtsLaunchCpuKernel` on every task |
| AICore binary | `rtRegisterAllKernel` handle | Lazily registered on the first `launch_aicore_kernel()`, then the cached handle is reused |
| Kernel binaries | `func_id_to_addr_` (device GM addresses) | Per-task: uploaded to device GM, cached by func_id |
| CANN HAL | `g_hal_handle` (file-scope static) | Process lifetime: loaded once for profiling, never closed |

### Key difference

Onboard caches more aggressively. The `DeviceRunner` persists across tasks
within a runtime group, the runtime AICPU SO is preinstalled once through the
dispatcher bootstrap, and per-task launches reuse cached `rtFuncHandle`s.
Simulation also retains the AICPU SO across runs so `g_aicpu_executor` can
reuse its orchestration-SO cache; `AicpuExecutor::deinit()` resets its per-run
state. The AICore SO is reloaded for each run because its kernel binary varies
per callable.

Onboard per-task launches pass the front-less `KernelArgs` payload directly to
`rtsLaunchCpuKernel` with no CANN launch front: runtime state flows through
`runtime_args` (at offset 0) and the other profiling/logging/register fields.
AICore receives only a device copy of that same `KernelArgs` payload.
