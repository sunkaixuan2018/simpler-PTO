"""SPMD multi-block MIX: five MIX tasks with varying block_num.

  T0 (block_num=2):  basic multi-block MIX
  T1 (block_num=8):  saturates one sched thread
  T2 (block_num=12): forces cross-thread dispatch
  T3 (block_num=24): occupies all clusters across all 3 sched threads
  T4 (block_num=48): two full rounds of all clusters

Each block occupies 3 cache lines (AIC, AIV0, AIV1). All three cores
in the same block write float(block_idx) to their respective CL.
